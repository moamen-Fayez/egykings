            <h1>Ruled Egypt for almost 54 years</h1>
            <h2>Born 1481 BC</h2>
            <p>
              Thutmose III was the son of Thutmose II by a secondary wife, Iset .His father's great royal wife was Queen Hatshepsut.
              Her daughter, Neferure, was Thutmose's half-sister.When Thutmose II died, Thutmose III was too young to rule. Hatshepsut
                became his regent, soon his co-regent, and shortly thereafter declared herself to be the queen while never denying kingship 
                to Thutmose III. Thutmosis III had little power over the empire while Hatshepsut exercised the formal titulary of kingship.
                Her rule was quite prosperous and marked by great advancements. When Thutmose III reached a suitable age and demonstrated 
                the capability, she appointed him to head her armies

            <h1>Military Campaigns</h1>
            <p>
            Widely considered a military genius by historians, Thutmose III conducted at least 16 campaigns in 20 years. He was an active 
            expansionist ruler, sometimes called Egypt's greatest conqueror or "the Napoleon of Egypt" by the Egyptologist James Breasted.
            He is recorded to have captured 350 cities during his rule and conquered much of the Near East from the Euphrates to Nubia during
              seventeen known military campaigns. He was the first pharaoh after Thutmose I to cross the Euphrates, doing so during his campaign
              against Mitanni. His campaign records were inscribed onto the walls of the temple of Amun at Karnak (transcribed in Urkunden IV). 
              He is consistently regarded as one of the greatest of Egypt's warrior pharaohs who transformed Egypt into an international
                superpower by creating an empire that stretched from the Asian regions of Syria to the North, to Upper Nubia to the south.
                Whether the Egyptian empire covered even more areas is less certain. Earlier Egyptologists, most recently Ed. Meyer, believed 
                that Thutmose had also subjugated the islands of the Aegean Sea. This can no longer be upheld today. A conquest of Mesopotamia
                is unthinkable; and whether tribute sent from Alashia (Cyprus) was more than occasional gifts remains questionable. In most of his
                  campaigns, his enemies were defeated town by town until they were beaten into submission.

            <h1> Monumental construction</h1>
            
            <p>
            Thutmose III was a great builder and constructed over 50 temples, although some of these are now lost and only mentioned in written 
            records. He also commissioned the building of many tombs for nobles, which were made with greater craftsmanship than ever before. 
            His reign was also a period of great stylistic changes in the sculpture, paintings and reliefs associated with construction, much 
            of it beginning during the reign of Hatshepsut.

            The length of Thutmose III's reign is known to the day thanks to information found in the tomb of the military commander Amenemheb-Mahu.
            Amenemheb-Mahu records Thutmose III's death to his master's 54th regnal year, on the 30th day of the third month of Peret.
              The day of Thutmose III's accession is known to be I Shemu day four, and astronomical observations can be used to establish the exact

            <h1>Death</h1>
            <h2>1425 BC</h2>
            <p>
              Thutmose's tomb was discovered by Victor Loret in 1898 in the Valley of the Kings. It uses a plan which is typical of 18th Dynasty tombs,
              with a sharp turn at the vestibule preceding the burial chamber. Two stairways and two corridors provide access to the vestibule, which 
              is preceded by a quadrangular shaft or "well".A complete version of Amduat, an important New Kingdom funerary text, is in the vestibule,
                making it the first tomb where Egyptologists found the complete text. According to the American Egyptologist Peter Der Manuelian, a 
                statement in the tomb biography of an official named Amenemheb establishes that Thutmose III died in Year 54, III Peret day 30 of his
                reign after ruling Egypt for "53 years, 10 months and 26 days" (Urk. 180.15). Thutmose III died one month and four days shy of the
                  start of his 54th regnal year. When the co-regencies with Hatshepsut and Amenhotep II are deducted, he ruled alone for just over
                  30 of those years.
