                  The future Akhenaten was born Amenhotep, a younger son of king Amenhotep III and his principal wife Tiye. Akhenaten had an elder
                  brother, crown prince Thutmose, who was recognized as Amenhotep III's heir. Akhenaten also had four or five sisters: Sitamun, 
                  Henuttaneb, Iset, Nebetah, and possibly Beketaten. Thutmose's early death, perhaps around Amenhotep III's thirtieth regnal year,

                    Akhenaten is noted for abandoning Egypt's traditional polytheism and introducing Atenism, or worship centered around Aten. The views
                    of Egyptologists differ as to whether the religious policy was absolutely monotheistic, or whether it was monolatry, syncretistic, or
                      henotheistic. This culture shift away from traditional religion was reversed after his death. Akhenaten's monuments were dismantled
                      and hidden, his statues were destroyed, and his name excluded from lists of rulers compiled by later pharaohs.Traditional religious
                        practice was gradually restored, notably under his close successor Tutankhamun, who changed his name from Tutankhaten early in his
                        reign. When some dozen years later, rulers without clear rights of succession from the Eighteenth Dynasty founded a new dynasty,
                          they discredited Akhenaten and his immediate successors and referred to Akhenaten as "the enemy" or "that criminal" in archival
                          records.Akhenaten was all but lost to history until the late-19th-century discovery of Amarna, or Akhetaten, the new capital 
                          city he built for the worship of Aten. Furthermore, in 1907, a mummy that could be Akhenaten's was unearthed from the tomb KV55
                            in the Valley of the Kings by Edward R. Ayrton. Genetic testing has determined that the man buried in KV55 was Tutankhamun's 
                            father, but its identification as Akhenaten has since been questioned.

                  <p>
                  The Amarna letters have provided important evidence about Akhenaten's reign and foreign policy. The letters are a cache of 382
                  diplomatic texts and literary and educational materials discovered between 1887 and 1979, and named after Amarna, the modern name 
                  for Akhenaten's capital Akhetaten. The diplomatic correspondence comprises clay tablet messages between Amenhotep III, Akhenaten,
                    and Tutankhamun, various subjects through Egyptian military outposts, rulers of vassal states, and the foreign rulers of Babylonia,
                    Assyria, Syria, Canaan, Alashiya, Arzawa, Mitanni, and the Hittites.The Amarna letters portray the international situation in the
                      Eastern Mediterranean that Akhenaten inherited from his predecessors. In the 200 years preceding Akhenaten's reign, following the
                      expulsion of the Hyksos from Lower Egypt at the end of the Second Intermediate Period, the kingdom's influence and military might
                        increased greatly. Egypt's power reached new heights under Thutmose III, who ruled approximately 100 years before Akhenaten and
                        led several successful military campaigns into Nubia and Syria. Egypt's expansion led to confrontation with the Mitanni, but 
                        this rivalry ended with the two nations becoming allies. Slowly, however, Egypt's power started to wane. Amenhotep III aimed 
                        to maintain the balance of power through marriages—such as his marriage to Tadukhipa, daughter of the Mitanni king Tushratta—and
                          vassal states. Under Amenhotep III and Akhenaten, Egypt was unable or unwilling to oppose the rise of the Hittites around Syria.

                  <p>
                  Egyptologists know little about the last five years of Akhenaten's reign, beginning in c.1341 or 1339 BC. These years are poorly 
                  attested and only a few pieces of contemporary evidence survive; the lack of clarity makes reconstructing the latter part of the
                  pharaoh's reign "a daunting task" and a controversial and contested topic of discussion among Egyptologists. Among the newest
                    pieces of evidence is an inscription discovered in 2012 at a limestone quarry in Deir el-Bersha, just north of Akhetaten, 
                    from the pharaoh's sixteenth regnal year. The text refers to a building project in Amarna and establishes that Akhenaten 
                    and Nefertiti were still a royal couple just a year before Akhenaten's death.The inscription is dated to Year 16, month 3 of 
                    Akhet, day 15 of the reign of Akhenaten.

                  <h2>Died	1336 or 1334 BC</h2>
                  <p>
                  Akhenaten died after seventeen years of rule and was initially buried in a tomb in the Royal Wadi east of Akhetaten. The order to 
                  construct the tomb and to bury the king there was commemorated on one of the boundary stela delineating the capital's 
                  borders: "Let a tomb be made for me in the eastern mountain of Akhetaten. Let my burial be made in it, in the millions 
                  of jubilees which the Aten, my father, decreed for me." In the years following the burial, Akhenaten's sarcophagus was 
                  destroyed and left in the Akhetaten necropolis; reconstructed in the 20th century, it is in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo 
                  as of 2019. Despite leaving the sarcophagus behind, Akhenaten's mummy was removed from the royal tombs after Tutankhamun 
                  abandoned Akhetaten and returned to Thebes. It was most likely moved to tomb KV55 in Valley of the Kings near Thebes. 
                  This tomb was later desecrated, likely during the Ramesside period.Whether Smenkhkare also enjoyed a brief independent 
                  reign after Akhenaten is unclear. If Smenkhkare outlived Akhenaten, and became sole king, he likely ruled Egypt for less 
                  than a year. The next successor was Nefertiti or Meritaten ruling as Neferneferuaten, reigning in Egypt for about two years.
                  She was, in turn, probably succeeded by Tutankhaten, with the country being administered by the vizier and future king Ay
