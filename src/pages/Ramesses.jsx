            <p>Early in his life, Ramesses II embarked on numerous campaigns to restore possession of previously held territories lost to the
              Nubians and Hittites and to secure Egypt's borders. He was also responsible for suppressing some Nubian revolts and carrying out

                  to have totaled some 100,000 men: a formidable force that he used to strengthen Egyptian influence
