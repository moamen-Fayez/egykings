              <h2>Born	C. 1370 BC</h2>
              <p>Almost nothing is known about Nefertiti's life prior to her marriage to Akhenaten. Scenes from the tombs of the nobles in Amarna mention
                that Nefertiti had a sister, named Mutbenret. Further, a woman named Tey carried the title of "Nurse of the Great Royal Wife." In addition,
                  Tey's husband Ay carried the title "God's Father." Some Egyptologists believe that this title was used for a man whose daughter married the 
                  pharaoh. Based on these titles, it has been proposed that Ay was in fact Nefertiti's father. However, neither Ay or Tey are explicitly
                  referred to as Nefertiti's parents in the existing sources. At the same time, no sources exist that directly contradict Ay's fatherhood
                    which is considered likely due to the great influence he wielded during Nefertiti's life and after her death. According to another
                    theory, Nefertiti was the daughter of Ay and a woman besides Tey, but Ay's first wife died before Nefertiti's rise to the position
                      of queen, whereupon Ay married Tey, making her Nefertiti's stepmother. Nevertheless, this entire proposal is based on speculation
                      and conjecture

              <p>
                  During the early years in Thebes, Akhenaten (still known as Amenhotep IV) had several temples erected at Karnak. One of the 
                  structures, the Mansion of the Benben (hwt-ben-ben), was dedicated to Nefertiti. She is depicted with her daughter Meritaten 
                  and in some scenes the princess Meketaten participates as well. In scenes found on the talatat, Nefertiti appears almost twice
                  as often as her husband. She is shown appearing behind her husband the pharaoh in offering scenes in the role of the queen 
                  supporting her husband, but she is also depicted in scenes that would have normally been the prerogative of the king. She is 
                  shown smiting the enemy, and captive enemies decorate her throne.In the fourth year of his reign, Amenhotep IV decided to move 
                  the capital to Akhetaten 'modern Amarna'. In his fifth year, Amenhotep IV officially changed his name to Akhenaten, and Nefertiti
                  was henceforth known as Neferneferuaten-Nefertiti. The name change was a sign of the ever-increasing importance of the cult of
                    the Aten. It changed Egypt's religion from a polytheistic religion to a religion which may have been better described as a 
                    monolatry (the depiction of a single god as an object for worship) or henotheism 'one god, who is not the only god'

              <h1> What A Mystery</h1>
              
              <p>
                Nefertiti's burial was intended to be made within the Royal Tomb as laid out in the Boundary Stelae. It is possible that the unfinished 
                annex of the Royal Tomb was intended for her use. However, given that Akhenaten appears to have predeceased her it is highly unlikely she 
                was ever buried there. One shabti is known to have been made for her. The unfinished Tomb 29, which would have been of very similar 
                dimensions to the Royal Tomb had it been finished, is the most likely candidate for a tomb begun for Nefertiti's exclusive use. Given 
                that it lacks a burial chamber, she was not interred there either.In 2015, English archaeologist Nicholas Reeves announced that high
                resolution scans revealed voids behind the walls of Tutankhamun's tomb which he proposed to be the burial chamber of Nefertiti, but
                subsequent radar scans showed that there are no hidden chambers

              <h1> The Mummy</h1>
              <p>One of the two female mummies found in KV21 tomb has been suggested as the body of Nefertiti. DNA analysis did not yield enough data to make
                a definitive identification but confirmed she was a member of the Eighteenth Dynasty royal line. CT-scanning revealed she was about 45 at
                  the time of her death; her left arm had been bent over her chest in the 'queenly' pose. The possible identification is based on her
                  association with the mummy tentatively identified as Ankhesenamun. It is suggested that just as a mother and daughter 'Tiye and the
                    Younger Lady' were found lying together in KV35 tomb, the same was true of these mummies.

              Pre-2012 Egyptological theories thought that Nefertiti vanished from the historical record around Year 12 of Akhenaten's reign, with no word 
              of her thereafter. Conjectured causes included injury, a plague that was sweeping through the city, and a natural cause. This theory was
              based on the discovery of several ushabti fragments inscribed for Nefertiti. In 2012, the discovery of an inscription dated to Year 16, month 3 of Akhet,
                day 15 of the reign of Akhenaten was announced. It was discovered within Quarry 320 in the largest wadi of the limestone quarry at Dayr 
                Abū Ḥinnis.The five line inscription, written in red ochre, mentions the presence of the "Great Royal Wife, His Beloved, Mistress of
                the Two Lands, Neferneferuaten Nefertiti". The final line of the inscription refers to ongoing building work being carried out under 
                the authority of the king's scribe Penthu on the Small Aten Temple in Amarna. Van der Perre stresses that:This inscription offers 
                incontrovertible evidence that both Akhenaten and Nefertiti were still alive in the 16th year of his ''Akhenaten's'' reign and,
                  more importantly, that they were still holding the same positions as at the start of their reign. This makes it necessary to rethink
                  the final years of the Amarna Period.
