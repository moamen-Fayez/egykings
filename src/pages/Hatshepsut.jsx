                    Hatshepsut came to the throne of Egypt in 1478 BC. As the principal wife of Thutmose II, Hatshepsut initially ruled as regent to 
                    Thutmose III, a son of Thutmose II by another wife and the first male heir. While Thutmose III had inherited the throne at about
                    two years old, Hatshepsut continued to rule by asserting her lineage as the daughter and only child of Thutmose I and his primary 
                    wife, Ahmose.Her husband Thutmose II was the son of Thutmose I and a secondary wife named Mutnofret, who carried the title 'King's 
                    daughter' and was probably a child of Ahmose I. Hatshepsut and Thutmose II had a daughter named Neferure. Thutmose II with Iset,
                      a secondary wife, would father Thutmose III, who would succeed Hatshepsut as pharaoh

                  <p>
                  Hatshepsut was one of the most prolific builders in Ancient Egypt, commissioning hundreds of construction projects throughout both Upper 
                  Egypt and Lower Egypt. Many of these building projects were temples to build her religious base and legitimacy beyond her position 
                  as God's Wife of Amun. At these temples, she performed religious rituals that had hitherto been reserved for kings, corroborating 
                  the evidence that Hatshepsut assumed traditionally male roles as pharaoh. Arguably, her buildings were grander and more numerous 
                  than those of her Middle Kingdom predecessors. Later, pharaohs attempted to claim some of her projects as theirs. She employed the 
                  great architect Ineni, who also had worked for her father, her husband, and for the royal steward Senenmut. During her reign, so
                  much statuary was produced that almost every major museum with Ancient Egyptian artifacts in the world has Hatshepsut statuary 
                  among their collections; for instance, the Hatshepsut Room in New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art is dedicated solely to 
                  some of these pieces. The extant artifacts of the statuary provide archaeological evidence of Hatshepsut's portrayals of herself
                    as a male pharaoh, with physically masculine traits and traditionally male Ancient Egyptian garb, such as a false beard and ram's 
                    horns.

                  <p>
                  Hatshepsut built the Temple of Pakhet at Beni Hasan in the Minya Governorate south of Al Minya. The name, Pakhet, was a synthesis that 
                  occurred by combining Bast and Sekhmet, who were similar lioness war goddesses, in an area that bordered the north and south division of
                  their cults. The cavernous underground temple, cut into the rock cliffs on the eastern side of the Nile, was admired and called 
                  the Speos Artemidos by the Greeks during their occupation of Egypt, known as the Ptolemaic Dynasty. They saw the goddess as akin 
                  to their hunter goddess, Artemis. The temple is thought to have been built alongside much more ancient ones that have not survived.
                    This temple has an architrave with a long dedicatory text bearing Hatshepsut's famous denunciation of the Hyksos that James 
                    P. Allen has translated.[29] The Hyksos occupied Egypt and cast it into a cultural decline that persisted until a revival of 
                    her policies and innovations. This temple was altered later, and some of its inside decorations were usurped by Seti I of the 
                    Nineteenth Dynasty in an attempt to have his name replace that of Hatshepsut.

                  <p>
                  One of the most famous examples of the legends about Hatshepsut is a myth about her birth. In this myth, Amun goes to Ahmose in 
                  the form of Thutmose I and awakens her with pleasant odors. At this point Amun places the ankh, a symbol of life, to Ahmose's nose, 
                  and Hatshepsut is conceived by Ahmose. Khnum, the god who forms the bodies of human children, is then instructed to create a body
                  and ka, or corporal presence/life force, for Hatshepsut. Heket, the goddess of life and fertility, and Khnum then lead Ahmose along
                    to a lioness' bed where she gives birth to Hatshepsut. Reliefs depicting each step in these events are at Karnak and in her mortuary
                    temple.
